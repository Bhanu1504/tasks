        <p><b>Subhas Chandra Bose</b> (/ʃʊbˈhɑːs ˈtʃʌndrə ˈboʊs/ ⓘ shuub-HAHSS CHUN-drə BOHSS;[12] 23 January 1897 – 18 August 1945) was an <mark>Indian nationalist</mark> whose defiance of British authority in India made him a hero among many Indians, but his wartime alliances with <b><i>Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan</i></b> left a legacy vexed by authoritarianism, <del>anti-Semitism</del>, and military failure. The honorific <ins>Netaji</ins> (Bengali: "Respected Leader") was first applied to Bose in Germany in early 1942—by the Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German and Indian officials in the <small>Special Bureau for India in Berlin</small>. It is now used throughout India.[h]</p>
